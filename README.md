## Getting Started

Clone the repository and import it to a Spring Tool Suite IDE and press "Run as Java Application"

### Prerequisites
I've used Spring to generate the sample data.
So if you want to load sample data, you need to create them as beans in the file /src/main/java/com/jpmorgan/beans/beans.xml
The name of this beans must be trade1, trade2, trade3, ..... tradeN
